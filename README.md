# Welcome to your Expo app üëã

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## tasks not to be forgotten

From codex openai chat

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôd shore up before handing the app to outside testers:

Secure API access ‚Äì the OpenAI key lives in the client bundle; anyone installing the app will see it. Either proxy requests through your own backend or inject secrets at build time so testers can run it safely.
Loading & error states ‚Äì after tapping Find Out the UI doesn‚Äôt indicate that work is happening (and the button stays active). Add a spinner/disabled state and surface API failures inside the dialog so testers aren‚Äôt guessing.
Time selection controls ‚Äì the clock is read-only now. Testers need a way to simulate different parking times; bring back (or redesign) a manual picker or scenario presets.
Photo ingestion flexibility ‚Äì only live camera capture is supported. Give testers a ‚Äúchoose from library‚Äù option so they can reuse sample signs or retry without retaking photos.
Result clarity & history ‚Äì the modal disappears forever once closed. Consider storing the last response, offering a ‚ÄúView Previous Result,‚Äù and adding context (confidence, warnings) so testers can evaluate consistency.
Instrumentation & logging ‚Äì light analytics or structured console logs (hidden behind a debug toggle) will help you interpret tester feedback without relying on them to describe every interaction.
